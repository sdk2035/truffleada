1. Overview
   --------

JGNAT is the Ada 95 development environment that targets the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM). JGNAT comes with complete sources.

Please note that, unless you are using GLIDE (the GNAT IDE), all JGNAT tools
are command-line tools. This means that they must be invoked from the shell
(UNIX) or DOS window (Microsoft Windows).

See the section "Contact Information" for details on how to obtain the
supported version of JGNAT or for information on GLIDE.

See the section "Problem Reports" for details on how to report problems that
you may find in JGNAT.


2. System Requirements
   -------------------

The minimal system requirements for the host computer where you intend to run
the JGNAT tools are:

   o At least 8 megabytes of available RAM not used by your operating system
   o 40 megabytes of free disk space

The binary versions available for this release of JGNAT are:

   o Compaq Tru64 Unix
   o GNU/Linux
   o Sun/Solaris
   o Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0

See the section "Building the JGNAT Release from Sources" if you would like
to build JGNAT on a host other than the ones listed above or if you would
like to rebuild the release yourself (this is straight-forward).

You can use any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run the Ada programs compiled
with JGNAT. Likewise, you can use any JVM debugger to debug the Ada programs
compiled with JGNAT.


3. JGNAT Release Files
   -------------------

The JGNAT release is packaged in several files:

   o jgnat-1.1p-README.txt      [This file is in UNIX ASCII format]
   o jgnat-1.1p-<HOST>.tgz      [One for each UNIX host for which
                                      a complete binary release was built]

   o jgnat-1.1p-README-dos.txt  [This file in DOS ASCII format]
   o jgnat-1.1p-nt.exe          [Self-extracting MS Windows NT release]

where:

   - 1.1p is the version of this JGNAT release. 

   - <HOST> gives the designation of the host computer on which the executables
     contained in the compressed file were built. Specifically, <HOST> is the
     string returned by the command gcc -dumpmachine (with the exception of
     the Windows release where <HOST> is simply the string "nt").

In addition to the above files the release includes a subdirectory
"split-1.1p" containing each of the host independent components of the
JGNAT release in a separate compressed file, specifically:

   o jgnat-1.1p-doc.tgz         [JGNAT documentation]
   o jgnat-1.1p-src.tgz         [JGNAT sources]
   o jgnat-1.1p-examples.tgz    [JGNAT examples]

The ASCII format used for text files in the "split-1.1p" directory is
UNIX ASCII (that is, a line is terminated with a 0x0A character only rather
than with the two characters 0x0D 0x0A as on Microsoft Windows systems). 


4. Uncompressing the JGNAT Release
   -------------------------------

Download the JGNAT release that corresponds to your host computer.
Let <install-dir> denote the directory under which you would like to unpack
the JGNAT release. When upacked, the JGNAT release will consist of a single
subdirectory "jgnat-1.1p" under <install-dir>. See the section
"Structure of the JGNAT Release" for more information on the contents of
directory "jgnat-1.1p".

To unpack the release under Windows, just run the self-extracting executable.
When prompted for the directory where you would like to unzip JGNAT, just
type in <install-dir> and click the "Unzip" button. After everything has
been unzipped the "notepad" program will be run displaying this file.

If you are not on Windows, then copy the appropriate JGNAT release file
jgnat-1.1p-<HOST>.tgz to <install-dir> and proceed as follows (assuming
$ is your prompt):

   $ cd  <install-dir>
   $ gunzip -c jgnat-1.1p-<HOST>.tgz | tar xf -


5. Installing JGNAT
   -----------------

Before proceeding with the installation of JGNAT make sure that:

   o The environment variable ADA_INCLUDE_PATH does not include the
     GNAT Ada library source directory (something ending in "adainclude")

   o The environment variable ADA_OBJECTS_PATH does not include the
     GNAT Ada library object directory (something ending in "adalib")

otherwise JGNAT will use the wrong version of the Ada library. In fact,
normally you want the above environment variables to be set to empty when
using JGNAT, unless you're using them to indicate your own set of
source/object directories. If using both GNAT and JGNAT in the same session,
then you need to make sure that the variables are set appropriately when
running each compiler (you may want to use scripts to facilitate
this). Another approach is simply to use separate windows and shell sessions
to avoid interference.

After having checked the above and having uncompressed JGNAT in <install-dir>,
add the directory:

   o <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/bin  [on UNIX]
   o <install-dir>\jgnat-1.1p\bin  [on Windows] 

to your PATH environment variable (this is not just a convenience, it is
necessary to ensure that JGNAT will work). To make sure you set the PATH
variable properly, open a new shell (UNIX) or DOS window (Windows) and
just type "jgnat". The JGNAT compiler usage instructions should be displayed
on your screen.

Finally, you have to tell your JVM where to find the .class files that are
part of the JGNAT library. If you are using the JVM that comes with Sun's JDK
1.1.* or later see below, otherwise please consult the documentation of your
JVM.

To tell Sun's JVM (JDK 1.1.* or later) where to find the JGNAT .class files,
you must set the CLASSPATH environment variable to the following value:

   o .:<install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/lib/jgnat.jar  [on UNIX]
   o .;<install-dir>\jgnat-1.1p\lib\jgnat.jar  [on Windows]

This will tell the JVM to look for class files in your current directory (".")
first and then in the JAR file <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/lib/jgnat.jar.
Note the difference in separators (":" is used on UNIX and ";" is used on
Windows).

To test that your CLASSPATH variable is set correctly, put the following Ada
program in a file named hello.adb:

     with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
     procedure Hello is
     begin
        Put_Line ("hello JGNAT");
     end Hello;

and compile it with the following command:

   $ jgnatmake hello

After that, invoke the JVM on hello.class by typing 

   $ java hello

and it should output the message: 

     hello JGNAT

If you get an error, exception, or any other message then there is an
installation problem.

If all of the above worked successfully then JGNAT is ready to use.


6. Symbolic Links & the JGNAT Installation
   ---------------------------------------

You cannot use symbolic links to point to your JGNAT executables. 
You really need to make sure the JGNAT executables are on your PATH. 

This is because the JGNAT tools locate the Ada library relative to the
directory where the JGNAT executables are found (which also means that
you must keep all JGNAT executables together).


7. Structure of the JGNAT Release
   ------------------------------

After you have uncompressed the JGNAT release in <install-dir>, <install-dir>
will contain the subdirectory jgnat-1.1p, which is structured as follows: 

     jgnat-1.1p
          |
          +--> bin [contains the JGNAT executables: jgnat, jgnatmake, etc.]
          |
          +--> lib [contains the JGNAT Ada 95 library]
          |     |
          |     +--> jgnat.jar [JAR containing all *.class of the JGNAT lib]
          |     |
          |     +--> jgnat
          |           |
          |           +--> adainclude [Ada library sources: spec and bodies]
          |           |
          |           +--> adalib     [.ali files of the Ada library]
          |
          +--> doc [contains the JGNAT documentation in various formats]
          |
          +--> src [contains all JGNAT sources]
          |
          +--> examples [contains all JGNAT examples]


8. Installing JGNAT on Top of Your GNAT Installation
   -------------------------------------------------

It is possible to install JGNAT on top of your GNAT installation. To do that
you need to:

(a) Move the JGNAT executables contained in jgnat-1.1p/bin into directory
    <gnat-dir>/bin, where <gnat-dir> denotes the directory where you have
    installed GNAT:

    o cp   <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/bin/* <gnat-dir>/bin     [on UNIX]
    o copy <install-dir>\jgnat-1.1p\bin\*.exe <gnat-dir>/bin [on Windows]

(b) Move the JGNAT library contained in jgnat-1.1p/lib into directory
    <gnat-dir>/lib:

    o cp   <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/lib/* <gnat-dir>/lib     [on UNIX]
    o copy <install-dir>\jgnat-1.1p\lib\* <gnat-dir>/lib     [on Windows]

(c) Follow the instructions given in the section "Installing JGNAT" replacing
    every instance of:

    o <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/  [on Unix]
    o <install-dir>\jgnat-1.1p\  [on Windows]

    with

    o <gnat-dir>/  [on UNIX]
    o <gnat-dir>\  [on Windows]


9. Building the JGNAT Release from Sources
   ---------------------------------------

Most of JGNAT is written in Ada, apart from a few C modules. JGNAT is easily
made available for any platform where GNAT is available.  If you plan to
build JGNAT from sources, the system requirements are as follows:

   o GNAT 3.13 or later must be installed on your system.
   o SUN JDK 1.2 or later must be installed on your system.
   o You must use GNU make.
   o You must have GNU tar (this is not necessary if you are only building a
     release for yourself and are not going to package it for others).
   o On Windows systems you will need all the standard UNIX utilities
     such as: sh, cd, cp, rm, mv, sed, touch, chmod, echo, test, etc.

Let <install-dir> denote the directory under which you would like to build and
install the JGNAT release.  When completed, the JGNAT release will consist of a
single file:

   o jgnat-1.1p-<HOST>.tgz

which will be located in directory <install-dir> and whose structure is exactly
identical to other JGNAT release and <HOST> gives the designation of the host
computer for which this release was built. To actually build the release
proceed as follows:

(a) Go to the "split-1.1p" directory and download into <install-dir>:

       o jgnat-1.1p-src.tgz       [JGNAT sources]
       o jgnat-1.1p-doc.tgz       [JGNAT documentation]
       o jgnat-1.1p-examples.tgz  [JGNAT examples]

(b) Decompress the sources as shown below (assuming $ is your prompt):

       $ cd  <install-dir>
       $ gunzip -c jgnat-1.1p-src.tgz      | tar xf -
       $ gunzip -c jgnat-1.1p-doc.tgz      | tar xf -
       $ gunzip -c jgnat-1.1p-examples.tgz | tar xf -

(c) The above will create directory <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/src, from
    which you will launch the build process, as follows:

       $ cd <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/src
       $ make release     [you **must** use GNU make]

As a side note the above make command will generate the JGNAT executables and
JGNAT library for your host computer and will place them in directories

     <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/bin  [JGNAT executables]
     <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/lib  [JGNAT library]

the build for the JGNAT binaries will take place in directories

     <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/obj   (for the compilation tools)
     <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/objs  (for the other JGNAT tools)

For more information on the release or build process see the JGNAT makefile
(in <install-dir>/jgnat-1.1p/src/Makefile), it is well documented.


10. JGNAT Tools
    -----------

This version of JGNAT contains the following executables:

   o jgnat     - The JGNAT compiler.
   o jgnatbind - The JGNAT binder (used by jgnatmake).
   o jgnatlink - The JGNAT linker (used by jgnatmake).
   o jgnatmake - The JGNAT automatic Ada make tool.
   o jgnatls   - The JGNAT Ada library browser, a tool that provides various
                 information about compiled units.
   o jgnatfind - The JGNAT tool for locating definitions and uses of an Ada
                 entity or a set of Ada entities in a given set of Ada sources.
   o jgnatxref - The JGNAT cross-referencing tool, which gives cross-reference
                 information for a set of Ada units.
   o jgnatpsta - Prints the version of package Standard used by JGNAT.

   o jvmlist   - A tool to disassemble a JVM class file and list its contents
                 with embedded source file information.
   o jarmake   - A tool to make a single JAR file for an application built
                 with JGNAT. This is useful when you want to ship a self
                 contained application built with JGNAT to someone who does not
                 have JGNAT installed. This tool is very useful useful when
                 creating "gnapplets" (GNAT applets).
   o jvm2ada   - A tool to generate the Ada spec corresponding to a JVM class
                 file, supporting automatic interfacing of Ada and Java code.
   o jvmstrip  - A tool to strip debugging information from a class file.

Typing the name of the tool without any parameters displays a short message
on each tool's usage. 

The tools which have been specifically developed for JGNAT are:

   o jvmlist
   o jarmake
   o jvm2ada
   o jvmstrip

All other tools are regular GNAT tools that have been slightly adapted for use
with JGNAT. They are used in the same fashion as their corresponding GNAT
equivalent. 

The GNAT tools:

   o gnatls
   o gnatfind
   o gnatxref
   o gnatpsta

had to be adapted for JGNAT since they need to know where the Ada library is
located. If we had used the default GNAT tools instead of building JGNAT
specific ones the wrong version of the Ada library would have been used.

The GNAT tools which are completely target independent (gnatchop, gnatprep,
gnatelim, etc.) have not been provided with JGNAT. They are available in the
regular GNAT installation and you should use those directly.

Please consult the section "Additional Documentation" for more information on
JGNAT and its tools.


11. How to Use This Version of JGNAT
    --------------------------------

Before running JGNAT you must *carefully* follow the instructions detailed
in section "Installing JGNAT" (in particular read how to set the PATH and
CLASSPATH variables). Then, to compile an Ada unit in a source file
my_unit.adb type:

   $ jgnat my_unit.adb

This will produce one or more JVM class files and an .ali file (Ada library
information file).

You can also compile all the required units of an Ada program by running
jgnatmake on the main unit of your program:

   $ jgnatmake my_main_program   [or my_main_program.adb]

To run your program (assuming you are using Sun's JDK), simply type:

   $ java my_main_program

If you want to find out about available options on jgnatmake, jgnat, or the
other tools (e.g., jvmlist), simply execute the tool with no arguments and a
description of the valid command syntax and options will be printed.


12. Java Development Kits to Use with JGNAT
    ---------------------------------------

Because JGNAT generates class files that are fully compliant with Sun's JVM
standard, you can use any Java Virtual Machine and bytecode tools that meet
the Sun "Java Platform" standard.


13. JGNAT Debuggers
    ---------------

Because JGNAT generates class files that are fully compliant with Sun's JVM
standard, you can use any JVM debugger, such as Sun's jdb, with JGNAT.  As a
side note, there are several graphical interfaces to jdb. You can use DDD or
you can use GLIDE, the GNAT IDE.

The minor drawback of using a JVM debugger directly is that for those Ada
constructs not directly available in the Java programming language
(e.g., attributes), you need to know how JGNAT compiles these into bytecode
in order to retrieve their value. The JGNAT documentation (jgnat_ug) contains
a section that explains how to debug your Ada code with a JVM debugger.

Please note that certain simple-minded JVM debuggers expect all source
files to end with a ".java" extension (but this is not the case for jdb).


14. Additional Documentation
    ------------------------

The directory

     <install-dir>/gnat-1.1p/doc 

contains a copy of the JGNAT User Guide (in various formats). This user guide
will eventually be integrated in the GNAT User's Guide. The GNAT User's Guide
is particularly useful when trying to understand the meaning of switches used
by the JGNAT tools whose names start with the prefix "jgnat" (just look at
the description of the switches of the corresponding command without a "j"
in the GNAT User's Guide).


15. JGNAT Examples
    --------------

The directory

     <install-dir>/gnat-1.1p/examples

contains a number of interesting JGNAT applications and gnapplets (GNAT
applets). Be sure to check out the "animate" and "tictactoe" gnapplets and
Prof. Carlisle's exciting Rapid GUI builder. The directory "examples"
contains a README-EXAMPLES.txt file giving more details about all the JGNAT
examples.


16. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
    --------------------------------

Q: Can I create applets with JGNAT ?

A: You sure can. We actually call them "gnapplets" (for GNAT Applets). The
   chapter "Creating Gnapplets with JGNAT" explains how this can be done.


Q: I would like to use the Java Graphical API (AWT, Swing components) from my
   Ada application that runs natively. How can I do that?

A: If your Ada code does not have to run natively, you can compile it into
   JVM bytecode using JGNAT and then use the Java API (see the JGNAT
   documentation for information on how to do this).

   If your Ada code must run natively (e.g. for performance reasons or
   because you are doing low-level memory operations whose semantics violates
   the JVM security model), then you should really use the GTK/Ada graphical
   toolkit. GTK (Gimp Toolkit) is a platform-independent graphical toolkit
   which will run natively and is available for both UNIX and Windows
   platforms. GTK/Ada comes with a GUI builder and a comprehensive graphics
   library whose breadth and performance are superior to that of the Java
   API. As a side note, GTK is the GUI toolkit used in the GNOME project. For
   more information on GTK/Ada and how to obtain it please refer to the
   Contact Information section.

   If you really want to use the Java API from native Ada, you should use
   the JNI (Java Native Interface) library. JNI is a C API that allows you
   to create Java classes and objects and call Java methods from a native
   application. To use the JNI API from Ada, you need to specify pragma
   Import for the needed C routines and map the needed C types to Ada
   (see the section Suggestions for Interesting Tools and Enhancements).


17. Suggestions for Interesting Tools and Enhancements
    --------------------------------------------------

   o Send us some fun gnapplets to add to distribute with the release in the
     examples directory.

   o The feature in jvm2ada that retrieves the original parameter names from a
     .class file if debugging info is present or from the original java source
     is not implemented (see section "Parameter Names and Source Search Paths"
     in the JGNAT User's Guide). A good chunk of ths functionality is already
     implemented in file j_parser.ads. It would be nice to complete that work
     and integrated it into jvm2ada.

   o Make a thin Ada binding to the JNI (Java Native Interface) API (a C API).
     Make sure this Ada binding is portable across platforms (especially
     between UNIX and Widnows).

   o Make a *thick* Ada binding to the JNI (Java Native Interface) API
     (a C API). Make sure this Ada binding is portable across platforms
     (especially between UNIX and Windows).


18. Contact Information
    -------------------

For all inquiries concerning the GNAT technology (including JGNAT) please
send e-mail to sales@gnat.com or sales@act-europe.fr.


19. Problem Reports
    ---------------

For technical questions or if you would like to report problems, send an
e-mail to report@gnat.com with a subject line starting with:

    Subject: JGNAT: <...subject to summarize query....>

Submitting bug reports is a vital part of the process of the continuing
improvement of JGNAT. You will help us greatly if you follow these guidelines.

Please report each problem in a separate message, and add a short but specific
subject (a general subject like "JGNAT bug" is not very useful, a title like
"bug in handling of extension aggregates" is more useful).

Please include full sources. We can't duplicate errors without the full
sources. Include all sources in the single e-mail message with appropriate
indications in the multiple file case, see below. Also say exactly what you
saw, do not assume that we can guess what you saw, or duplicate the behavior
you encountered.

All sources must be sent in plain ASCII form.

To be maximally helpful, for a report that contains multiple separate
compilation units, and hence multiple files, submit them in the form of a
single file that is acceptable input to gnatchop (i.e., contains no non-Ada
text). If you use banners to separate the files, make sure they are composed
entirely of blank lines or Ada comments. The first line of sources should be
marked with an Ada comment line, and the sources should extend to the end of
the message. If you must include a signature, make it look like an Ada

Also, it is helpful if you try to reduce your example to a simple one.

If a bug involves incorrect operation of the generated code, then the first
thing the program should do is to output a line indicating the expected
output or behavior. If at all possible, do a test later on that prints out
"passed" or "failed" depending on the behavior. Of course it may not always
be possible to structure a test this way, but that's the most convenient
form.
