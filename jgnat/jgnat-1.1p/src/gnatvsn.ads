--  This package spec holds version information for GNAT, GNATBIND and
--  GNATMAKE. It is updated whenever the release number is changed.

package Gnatvsn is

   Gnat_Version_String : constant String := "1.1p (20000717)";
   --  Version output when GNAT (compiler), or its related tools, including
   --  GNATBIND, GNATCHOP, GNATFIND, GNATLINK, GNATMAKE, GNATXREF, are run
   --  (with appropriate verbose option switch set).
   --
   --  WARNING: some gnatmail scripts (at least make-bin and corcs) rely on
   --  the format of this string. Any change must be coordinated with
   --  a gnatmail maintainer.

   Ver_Len_Max : constant := 32;
   --  Longest possible length for Gnat_Version_String in this or any
   --  other version of GNAT. This is used by the binder to establish
   --  space to store any possible version string value for checks. This
   --  value should never be decreased in the future, but it would be
   --  OK to increase it if absolutely necessary.

   Library_Version : constant String := "GNAT Lib v3.13 ";
   --  Library version. This value must be updated whenever any change to the
   --  compiler affects the library formats in such a way as to obsolete
   --  previously compiled library modules.
   --  Note: Makefile.in relies on the format of this string to build
   --  the right soname.
